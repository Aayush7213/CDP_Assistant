## Overview

CDP Assistant is an intelligent chatbot that provides information, guidance, and assistance for Customer Data Platform operations. It helps users understand CDP concepts, troubleshoot issues, and optimize their customer data management strategies.

## Features

- **Conversational Interface**: Natural language interaction for easy communication
- **CDP Knowledge Base**: Comprehensive information about CDP concepts and best practices
- **Troubleshooting Support**: Help with common CDP-related issues
- **Data Management Guidance**: Recommendations for effective customer data handling
- **Integration Assistance**: Support for connecting CDPs with other systems
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Specialized knowledge for Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap

## Core Functionalities

### 1. Answer "How-to" Questions
The chatbot understands and responds to user questions about how to perform specific tasks or use features within each CDP.

Example questions:
- "How do I set up a new source in Segment?"
- "How can I create a user profile in mParticle?"
- "How do I build an audience segment in Lytics?"
- "How can I integrate my data with Zeotap?"

### 2. Extract Information from Documentation
The chatbot retrieves relevant information from the official documentation of each CDP to answer user questions accurately. It navigates through documentation, identifies relevant sections, and extracts necessary instructions or steps.

Data Sources:
- Segment Documentation: https://segment.com/docs/?ref=nav
- mParticle Documentation: https://docs.mparticle.com/
- Lytics Documentation: https://docs.lytics.com/
- Zeotap Documentation: https://docs.zeotap.com/home/en-us/

### 3. Handle Variations in Questions
The chatbot is designed to handle:
- Size variations (including extremely long questions without breaking down)
- Questions irrelevant to CDPs (e.g., "Which movie is getting released this week?")

### 4. Cross-CDP Comparisons
The chatbot can answer questions about the differences in approaches or functionalities between the four CDPs.

Example question: "How does Segment's audience creation process compare to Lytics'?"

### 5. Advanced "How-to" Questions
The chatbot handles complex or platform-specific "how-to" questions, providing guidance on advanced configurations, integrations, or use cases.
